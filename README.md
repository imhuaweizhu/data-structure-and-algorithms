from https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-top-data-structures-you-should-know-for-your-next-coding-interview-36af0831f5e3/

1. Arrays
2. Stacks
3. Queues
4. Linked Lists
5. Trees
6. Graphs
7. Tries (they are effectively trees, but it’s still good to call them out separately).
8. Hash Tables

## A Data structure is a collection of
from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure

1. A collection of data items.
2. The relationships among the data items.
3. The operations that can be applied to the data structure.


## Common operations on various Data Structures
from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/common-operations-on-various-data-structures/

A data structure to be efficient in some operations and inefficient in others. Your goal is to understand data structures so that you can pick the data structure that’s most optimal for the problem at hand.

1. Access: Get a data item in the given data structure.
2. Insert: Add a data item in the given data structure.
3. Delete: Delete a data item in the given data structure.
4. Search: Find a particular data item in the given data structure.

## Types of data structures
from https://techieshouts.com/types-of-data-structures/

### Primitive Data Structure
Predefined data types. They are supported by all programming languages. All the programming languages like java, c#, or any object-oriented programming language are all inherited from C and C++. For example:

Integer, Float, Char, Boolean, Pointer

### Non-primitive Data Structure

Not predefined in programming languages. They can be implemented with the help of primitive data types.

#### 1. Linear: The data items are arranged in a sequential manner.

#### 2. Nonlinear: The data items are not arranged in a sequential manner (e.g. a random manner)
