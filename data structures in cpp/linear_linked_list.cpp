/*
A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node-->the head of the linked list. 

The first node is called the head. 
If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head is NULL.

Each node in a list consists of at least two parts:
1) data
2) Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node

Advantages over static arrays
1) Dynamic size
2) Ease of insertion/deletion

Drawbacks:
1) Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the head.
2) Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
3) Not cache friendly, because elements are not in contiguous locations.
